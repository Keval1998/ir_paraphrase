Use the shared folder impl-https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NoWhs64hmQym9UERMBkuGyYvSL3xahBW for data.
If using google colab then run the cells one by one after changing BASE_DIR path with the path of folder impl shared. here 1.txt and 2.txt are dummy files to show the working. but to use full dataset change train.csv instead of 2.txt and test.csv instead of 1.txt; will take more than couple of hours for preprocessing and model fit, that's why 1.txt and 2.txt is used.
The google colab link is https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nnCG2sDm0uAR8-HpbpUc3GVaPw8hRrPY and comments are mentioned there to run the file. Use "Open in playground" option to run and set runtime enviornment to cpu with 12GB RAM that is default and lowest runtime confuguration(any higher runtime also will work).
If not using google colab then make sure RAM is atleast 8GB. and do change BASE_DIR path value only. but better to open file in colab and run directly.
